Hello! I'm Zihan Zhao, a CS & Math undergraduate at the [University of Wisconsin - Madison](https://www.wisc.edu). I'm currently doing research on an open-source serverless computing platform [OpenLambda](https://github.com/open-lambda/open-lambda), advised by [Dr. Tyler Harter](https://tyler.caraza-harter.com/). My focus is the optimization of CPU and memory usage in OL. Specifically, I'm exploring methods to reduce the unnecessary Copy-on-Writes caused by Python reference counting and garbage collection in large multiprocessing applications. Previously, I was working on the dynamics of trees and graphs, a pure math research problem, in [Madison Experimental Mathematics Lab](https://mxm.math.wisc.edu/), advised by [Prof. Chenxi Wu](https://wuchenxi.github.io/). We wrote a [research report](https://zihan-j-zhao.github.io/uploads/dynamics-of-trees-and-graphs.pdf) on this subject.

Now, I'm applying for **CS Ph.D. programs for 2024 Fall**. My research interests primarily include distributed systems, cloud computing, and database systems, but I'm also open to a broader breadth of "systems".
